# Mutants Assemble

<!-- TODO: Mutants assembled as a card game, with card deck and hands managed in an atom -->

In this section you will apply changes to values, how to define your own simple functions.

We will also introduce the following functions for the first time:

| function     | Description                                      |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `atom`       | create an anonymous function, one without a name |
| `deref`, `@` | assign a name to a function                      |

## Create a new Clojure project

[:fontawesome-solid-book-open: Pracitcalli Clojure CLI Config](/clojure/clojure-cli/practicalli-config/) provides the `:project/create` alias to create projects using deps-new project.

```bash
clojure -T:project/create :template app :name practicalli/mutants-assemble
```

Open the `src/practicalli/mutants_assemble.clj` file in a Clojure aware editor and start the REPL.

## Define an atom

Use the `def` function to bind a name to an atom.

The atom wraps data, initially an empty vector.

```clojure
(def mutants (atom []))
```

> The vector remains an immutable value, even though it is contained within a mutable atom container

Define a function using `defn` which takes a mutant as an argument and updates the value managed by the atom.  The reference to the atom is also an argument, making this a pure function and more generic as any given atom can be updated with this function.

```clojure

(defn add-mutant [mutants mutant]
  (swap! mutants conj mutant))
```

[`swap!`](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/swap!) uses a function to create a new value for the atom to manage.  In this case the `conj` function is used to join the value of mutant with the existing mutants atom value, creating a new vector.

[`swap!`](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/swap!) is a macro so the syntax is a little different. Essentially this is the same as an expression `(conj mutants mutant)`, with the value this returns swapped into the atom.

Call the function with the `mutants` atom and a mutant to add, which is a string containing the name of a mutant character.

```clojure
(add-mutant mutants "Black Widow")
```

The value the atom is managing has been swapped for a new value.  The original value was not modified (vectors are immutable) so the atom now points to a new value, a vector containing a string.

## Viewing the value managed by the atom

Use the `deref` function to see the value the atom is managing.

```clojure
(deref mutants)
```

It is idiomatic to use `@` which is a syntax alias for the `deref` function, rather than explicitly using `deref`.

```clojure
@mutants
```

## Reset the atom value

`reset!` will change the value managed by the atom by providing the new value.  This is simpler than using `swap!` as it does not use the existing value in the atom.

```
(reset! mutants [])
```

Now all the mutants are gone (and we can start looking for new ones to add).
