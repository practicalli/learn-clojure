# Code Kata

A kata is a small challenge that you attempt to solve in different ways, to experiment with alternative solutions to a challenge and widen experience.

Kata help gain understanding in a wider range of Clojure functions and ways to represent values in Clojure.

Code Kata can also be used to practice a Test Driven Development (TDD) approach.

## Guided Challenges

Challenges with design journals that describe and demonstrate different design choices and constraints.
