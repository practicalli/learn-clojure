## Learn more tools to help you think functionally

- mostly using immutable values and pure functions
- functional composition, sequences and transducers
- atoms for managing mutable state changes (with immutable values)


## Get a broader view of Clojure and learn some common practices

Start reading a book which is aimed at intermediate

- [Clojure CookBook](http://clojure-cookbook.com/)

Watch Video's about Clojure on subjects that are relevant to work or projects you want to work on.

- [ClojureTV on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/ClojureTV)

Follow tutorials on Clojure, especially those that introduce the amazing libraries available in Clojure

- [Lambda Island](https://lambdaisland.com/)
- [PurelyFunctional.tv](https://purelyfunctional.tv/)
- [Practical.li](https://practicalli,github.io)

Work with some of the most common libraries in Clojure

- [Ring]() / [Compojure]() for web development (server side)
- [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/) for web UI or native mobile apps (client side)
